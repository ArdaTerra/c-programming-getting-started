Your program should first read the total number of names (an integer) in order to know how many index cards 
need to be processed altogether. Next,  for each index card, your program should read a patron's first name 
and last name and then display these names correctly, that is on one line, the last name followed by one space, 
followed by the first name.  Your program should print the reversed name immediately after reading 
the patron's names (ie, it should not wait until it has read all of the index cards to begin printing). 

Note that, for ease of viewing, the example below shows all of the inputs in one block 
and all of the outputs in another block, despite the fact that programmatically these will be interspersed.  

Example
Input:
4
Alan Turing
Ada Lovelace
Donald Knuth
Claude Shannon
 

Output:
Turing Alan
Lovelace Ada
Knuth Donald
Shannon Claude

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int nb;
    scanf("%d", &nb);
    char firstN[101];
    char lastN[101];
    int i;
    for(i=0; i<nb; i++)
    {
        scanf("%s %s", firstN, lastN);
        printf("%s %s\n", lastN, firstN);
    }
    return 0;
}

/*second solution*/

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) 
{
  int num, i;
  char first[101], last[101];
  scanf("%d", &num);
  
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
  {
    scanf("%s", first);
    scanf("%s", last);
    printf("%s %s\n", last, first);
  }
  return 0;
}
