You want to determine the number of cities in a given region 
that have a population strictly greater than 10,000. 
To do this, you write a program that first reads the number of cities
in a region as an integer, and then the populations for each city one by one (also integers).

Example
Input
6
1000
5000
15000
4780
0
23590
Output
2

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int cities;
    int bigCities = 0;
    int i;
    scanf("%d\n", &cities);
    for(i=0; i<cities; i++)
        {
            int population; 
            scanf("%d\n", &population);
            if(population > 10 * 1000)
            {
                bigCities = bigCities + 1;
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n", bigCities);
        return 0;
}
