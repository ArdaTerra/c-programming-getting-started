divide decimals

Please write a C-program that starts by reading the amount of money you have (which may be a double), 
then reads the price per book (which again may be a double). The program should then display an integer, 
namely the largest number of books that you can purchase with the given amount of money.

Examples
Input
48.0
3.50
Output
13

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    double money, price;
    int book; 
    scanf("%lf %lf", &money, &price);
    book = (int) money/price;
    printf("%d\n", book);
    return 0;
}
